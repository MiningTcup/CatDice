# CatDice
Just a fun little game I made. Inspired by [Zombie Dice](https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jackson-Games-SJG-131313/dp/B003IKMR0U).

You're a cat. You try to catch 16 mice before your opponent. You can play against either another person at your computer, or against the bot I programmed.

Each turn, you will catch 3 things, each with the possibility of being a mouse, rat, or footsteps. A mouse is good, you need 16 to win. A rat is bad, if you get 3 on any given round, your turn ends immediatly. Footsteps are neutral, they mean the mouse escaped.
